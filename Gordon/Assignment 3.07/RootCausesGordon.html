          <div class="col"><h3><i><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MvlRbzKlHSAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA257&dq=+root+causes+to+students+being+less+engaged+in+astronomy&ots=YZFdOqoVMf&sig=Gn1VbrTynYAg4iogNZMuOnyKibQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">Evidence#1</a></i></h3> <p> In <i>Science education Issues and Developments</i> by Calvin L Petroselli, Michael C LoPresto of Henry Ford Community College states that "Since current research shows that most students learn very little from lectures, other approaches need to be employed."   </p></div>
          <div class="col"><h3><i> Explanation#1 </i></h3> <p> This shows the lack of educational resources that are implimented to Astronomy. Not all students learn and engage well in a lecture style class. Other instruction tailored toward different learning styles should be included, specifically in the visual learning department.    </p></div>
          <div class="col"><h3><i><a href="https://open.uct.ac.za/items/21b8628e-2cdf-40a7-aa7c-295a58fb930a">Evidence#2</a> </i></h3> <p> Since astronomy isn't a hands on study of science, the current atempts at instructing interested learning in astronomy are difficult. "A study in 2022 showed that there were similar dificulties to students understanding key concepts in Astronomy."  </p></div>
          <div class="col"><h3><i> Explanation#2 </i></h3> <p>  Astronomy faces a huge challenge when it comes to education. The limitations that come from being a less hands on science brings into account less active learning. Traditional learning can't apply the necessary engagement and interest to all students who take an introductory course to Astronomy.</p></div>

          <div class="col"><h3><i>Root Causes #2</i></h3> <p> The lack of accessibility and existences of current forms of education isn't effective enough for student (who are non science majors) that are trying to get into the field of astronomy. Even though current forms of virtual reality do exist, it is hard to impliment them into education because of prices/ affordability.  </p></div>

          <div class="col"><h3><i>Explanation#1</i></h3> <p>  Since many non science majors are less engaged with current education in astronomy more effective methods of teaching Astronomy should be included in teaching to combat the learning loss of students and make learning more engaging by visual means.  </p></div>

"VR can be difficult to deploy for reasons like cost and technical know-how at some schools and institutions."  </p></div>
          <div class="col"><h3><i><a href="https://www.applyboard.com/applyinsights-article/why-virtual-reality-can-make-learning-more-accessible-and-affordable#:~:text=The%20upfront%20cost%20of%20building,compared%20to%20classroom%2Dbased%20learners.">Explanation#2</a></i></h3> <p> "The upfront cost of building and implementing extended reality (XR) learning programs typically ranges from $20,000 to $100,000 USD.
            A 2022 PwC study found that 40% of VR learners were more confident in applying what theyâ€™ve been taught and 150% more engaged, compared to classroom-based learners." </p></div>

      <div class="row" id="Implications"> <h3><i>Implications (Solutions)</i></h3> <p> "In education, the metaverse is touted as making learning more accessible by lowering facility costs, lightening workloads, increasing engagement, improving learning outcomes and even reducing dropout rates. It can expand the existing concept of online universities, offering students unlimited access and trusted digital accreditations to meet specific regional curriculum requirements of the most cutting-edge campuses anywhere in the world."  </p>  </div>
